Scaleway Object Storage allows you to create [bucket policies](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-policy) directly from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). To create a bucket policy from the AWS CLI, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to create a bucket policy

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Bucket policies** tab.

3. Click **+ Create bucket policy**. A creation form displays.

4. Enter a name for your bucket policy.

5. Select a bucket to apply the policy to. 

    <Message type="note">
      You can only apply a policy to a single bucket, but you can [duplicate an existing policy]() and apply it to another bucket.
    </Message>

6. Select your preferred creation method:

    - the **policy generator** to add [statements](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#statement) using a form

    - the **JSON editor** to manually write or paste your bucket policy in a code editor.
