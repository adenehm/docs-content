HashiCorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. It provides encryption services that are gated by authentication and authorization methods to ensure secure, auditable and restricted access to secrets. It is used to secure, store and protect secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.


- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. Click the name of the cluster you wish to deploy your image on. The **Cluster information** tab displays.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab.
4. Click **Deploy application**. The application deployment wizard displays.
5. Select **Application library** to view a list of the available applications.
6. Select the **Vault** application.
    <Message type="tip">
        If you can not see the application on the first page of the library you can either type its name into the search bar to search for it or navigate through the library by using the arrow buttons.
    </Message>
7. Optionally, edit the default configuration for your application to customize it towards your needs. Easy Deploy uses [Helm Charts](/tutorials/kubernetes-package-management-helm/) to specify the application configuration. 
8. Enter a name and the Kubernetes namespace for your application. If no name is entered the application will be installed in the default namespace of the cluster.
9. Click **Deploy application** to deploy the application on your Kubernetes cluster.
