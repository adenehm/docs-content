[Scaleway Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/quickstart/) allows you to create and automate recurring tasks. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating snapshots of a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/quickstart/) on a recurring schedule using a Serverless Job.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Container Registry namespace](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/).
- Installed and started the [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to build the image.

## Building and pushing the imager to Container Registry

Serverless Jobs, like Serverless Containers (which are suited for HTTP applications), works
with Containers. So first, using your terminal reach this folder and run the following commands:

```shell
# First command is to login to container registry, you can find it in Scaleway console
docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/jobs-snapshot -u nologin --password-stdin <<< "$SCW_SECRET_KEY"

# Here we build the image to push
docker build -t rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/jobs-snapshot/jobs-snapshot:v1 .

# Push the image online to be used on Serverless Jobs
docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/jobs-snapshot/jobs-snapshot:v1
```

Note about Serverless Containers versus Serverless Jobs. As we do not expose a web server and we do not
require features such as auto-scaling, Serverless Jobs are perfect for this use case.

To check if everyting is ok, on the Console you can verify if your tag is present in Container Registry.

## Step 2: Creating the Job Definition

On Scaleway Console on the following link you can create a new Job Definition: https://console.scaleway.com/serverless-jobs/jobs/create?region=fr-par

1. On Container image, select the image you created in the step before.
2. You can set the image name to something clear like `jobs-snapshot` too.
3. For the region you can select the one you prefer :)
4. Regarding the resources you can keep the default values, this job is fast and do not require specific compute power or memory.
5. To schedule your job for example every night at 2am, you can set the cron to `0 2 * * *`.
6. Important: advanced option, you need to set the following environment variables:

    - `INSTANCE_ID`: grab the instance ID you want to create snapshots from
    - `INSTANCE_ZONE`: you need to give the ZONE of you instance, like `fr-par-2`
    - `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`: your access key
    - `SCW_SECRET_KEY`: your secret key
    - `SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID`: your organzation ID

7. Click "create job"

## Step 3: Run the job

On your created Job Definition, just click the button "Run Job" and within seconds it should be successful.

# Possible improvements

You can exercice by adding the following features:

- Instead of managing a single instance, make it account wide
- Add disk backups
- Add alerts if something goes wrong
